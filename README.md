My proposed solution to the prisoner's dilemma. My bot always starts off by cooperating. Before 4 moves are played, my bot basically perform tit for tat's strategy. 
Afterwards, I collect that 4 last moves of the enemy. If the enemy has played 4 straight moves of defect, my bot will defect as well. If the enemy has played 4 straight 
moves of cooperate, my bot will defect. Otherwise, the bot will take a random move from the enemy's last 4 moves and play it.
